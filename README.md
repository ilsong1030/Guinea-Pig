-Correlation of social hierachy & stress reaction-

The endocrine stress response is a homeostatic system—often termed the “fight-or-flight” response—driven primarily by the HPA axis. 
When a vertebrate encounters a stressor, the HPA axis secretes corticosterone (or cortisol in many mammals), and circulating levels are subsequently regulated by negative feedback.
Ambient temperature can itself act as a stressor; higher outside temperatures are associated with elevated blood cortisol levels (Michael Vogeser & Josef Biregel, 2007). 
Guinea pigs used in this study exhibit a pronounced, stable dominance hierarchy, and hierarchy stability can influence rises in cortisol (Olivia Furtado et al., 2014). 
In rodents such as guinea pigs, both cortisol and body temperature increase acutely after stress exposure; however, by ~120 minutes post-exposure, body temperature can fall to ~2 °C below that of non-exposed controls (Jan G. Veening et al., 2004).
Steroid hormones and glucocorticoids are key determinants of dominance rank (M. Mutwill, 2021; Hau & Goymann, 2015). 
In particular, testosterone is linked to courtship, aggression, territoriality, and mating behaviors (M. Mutwill, 2021; Hirschenhauser & Oliveira, 2006). 
Stable guinea-pig societies combine complex social bonding with dominance structures (Sachser, 1986). Glucocorticoids principally modulate energy mobilization to tissues and dominance-related behavior (Koolhaas et al., 2011). 
In stable social systems, low-ranking individuals do not necessarily mount a strong endocrine stress response; with age, social competencies that enable consensual conflict resolution can develop through family-like social contact (Sachser, 1998). 
Social buffering—stress attenuation via conspecific presence—typically operates through bonded partners rather than any group member (Sachser, 1998).
In the present experiment, males are separated from females and thus lack social support. 
Under conditions where social buffering is unavailable, low-ranking individuals are expected to show more stress-related events (e.g., aggressive bouts), higher plasma cortisol, and, additionally, elevated body temperature compared with higher-ranking conspecifics.
